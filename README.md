# Weather Dataset Analysis
In this project, we analyze a weather dataset using Python in a Jupyter Notebook. The primary objective is to process the dataset, address date parsing issues, and compute the mean temperature for various weather conditions. By leveraging libraries such as Pandas and NumPy, we successfully handle data preprocessing and analysis tasks.

## Objectives
- Date Parsing: Resolve issues related to date formatting and parsing within the dataset.
- Temperature Analysis: Calculate the mean temperature for different weather conditions to understand temperature trends.

## Tools and Libraries
- Python: The primary programming language used.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- NumPy: For numerical operations.
- Matplotlib: For data visualization.

## Key Findings
- Temperature Trends: We gained a basic understanding of temperature trends associated with specific weather conditions.
- Data Handling: Efficient processing and handling of date parsing issues within the dataset.

## Future Work
For further analysis, additional factors such as location, time of day, and seasonal variations could be considered. These factors would provide a more comprehensive understanding of weather patterns and temperature trends.

## Usage
To explore the analysis, follow these steps:
- Clone the repository.
- Open the Jupyter Notebook.
- Run the cells to reproduce the analysis.

## Conclusion
This project provides a foundational analysis of weather data, showcasing the ability to handle date parsing issues and compute mean temperatures for different weather conditions. The insights gained offer a basic understanding of temperature trends, and the project serves as a basis for more detailed future analyses incorporating additional factors.
